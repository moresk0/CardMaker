# CardMaker

App is made only for fun and learning. It's not 100% completed and bug free.

Test app for generating User ID cards as images

App uses SQLite for data storage (index, name, barcode).
For image (card) generation CV2 and PIL are used, as well barcode writer for barcode generation.

### Known bugs
